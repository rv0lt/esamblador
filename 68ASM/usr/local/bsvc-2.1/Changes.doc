BSVC Changes
============

 2.0 to 2.1: (11/08/98)
 
    a) Some minor changes were made to the user interface to support
       Tcl/Tk 8.0

    b) Some minor changes were made to the C++ code to support compiling
       with GCC 2.8.1

    c) Jorand Didier's Motorola 68360 (sim68360) simulator has been added 
       to the distribution.  It doesn't contain all of the 68360 devices 
       but it does provide a CPU32 based simulator.

    d) Xavier Plasencia's timer device has been added to the 68000
       simulator (modeled after the 68230 PI/T timer)

    e) Fixed a bug with the MOVEA instruction in the Motorola simulators

       - Thanks to Jorand Didier for pointing this problem out to me

    f) Added support for the ABCD and MOVEP instructions to the
       Motorola simulators

       - Thanks to Trappel Martin and Xavier Plasencia for this code

    g) Fixed bug in 68000 assembler when using $FFFF as an immediate 
       operand

       - Thanks to Craig A. Haynal for pointing this problem out to me


 2.0 Beta 1 to 2.0 (08/08/96):

    a) Modified the BSVC C++ framework to use "standard" C++ libraries
       (STL).  Most of this work was done by Seunghee Lee so the 
       framework could be ported to Windows 95.  

    b) Some minor changes were made to the user interface to support
       running it under Tcl/Tk for Windows 95.  This work was done
       by Seunghee Lee.

    c) Modified Sim68000 to work with the new version of the C++ framework

    d) Removed the Hector 1600 and MIL-STD-1750A simulators until they
       can be ported to the new framework

    e) Fixed a problem with the predecrement and postincrement addressing
       modes when the stack pointer and a byte size operation was specified

       - Thanks to Jorand Didier for pointing this problem out to me
     
 
 1.0.4 to 2.0 Beta 1 (02/10/96):

    a) User interface has undergone a major revision

    b) Oliver M. Kellogg's MIL-STD-1750A simulator has been added 
       to the distribution

    c) Breakpoints set using Tutor under Sim68000 work correctly

    d) Support for GCC 2.7.2 and Tk 4.0 added


 1.0.3 to 1.0.4 (07/31/95):

    a) Stack pointer bug in the ADDA, SUBA, CMPA, and LEA instructions fixed

       - Thanks to James Yuill at NCSU for reporting this bug


 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 (07/25/95):

    a) Bug in Sim68000's DIVS, BCHG, BCLR, BSET, and BTST instructions fixed

       - Thanks to Robert Woodside at NCSU for reporting the DIVS bug
       - Thanks to John R Potter at Penn State for reporting Bit instrution bug

    b) M68681 interrupt level bug fixed

    c) Sim68000 interrupt servicing modified so breakpoints at a service
       routine are handled correctly

       - Thanks to Jonathan Bredin at the University of Pennsylvania for 
         making me check the interrupts out

    d) Font resources changed for the GUI

    e) Insert registers in trace window bug fixed

       - Thanks to Stephanie Watson at NCSU for reporting the bug


 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 (02/18/95):

    a) Added support for the SUBX instruction to Sim68000

    b) Bug in Sim68000's CMPM and RTR instructions fixed

       - Thanks to John R Potter at Penn State for reporting the bug

    c) Mailing list for BSVC has been setup


 1.0 to 1.0.1 (02/11/95):

    a) Memory viewer's dump utility fixed

    b) Bug in Sim68000's CMP and CMPA instructions fixed

       - Thanks to John R Potter at Penn State for reporting the bug>

    c) Solaris support added


 1.0b3 to 1.0:

    a) The memory viewer has been made larger and faster

    b) WWW Home Page selection has been added to the help menu
       This starts a WWW browser pointed at the BSVC Home Page

    c) Added code to handle the STOP instruction

    d) Fixed a problem with the RTS instruction

    e) Unimplemented intructions cause an illegal instruction exception

    f) Fixed the 68000 assembler's INCLUDE directive so that it can
       be in any case

    g) Compiles with GCC 2.6.2

    
 1.0b2 to 1.0b3:

    a) Added an INCLUDE directive to the 68000 assembler
  
    b) Fixed a bug in the Program Listing window that caused it to
       only work for programs listed in ascending order
           
    c) Corrected a small problem with the file selector that caused it
       to "grab" the mouse while reading a directory (This causes problems
       with networked file systems that take a long time to read)

    d) Fixed bugs in two of the Framework classes that caused them not
       to compile under GCC 2.6.0


 1.0b1 to 1.0b2:

    a) Added a BREAK instruction to the 68000 simulator and assembler
       that acts like a breakpoint.  When the simulator executes this
       instruction while "running" it will stop running like it
       hit a breakpoint.

    b) Added a new file selector to the user interface

    c) Fixed several small bugs in the HECTOR 1600 simulator
