BSVC "A Microprocessor Simulation Framework"
============================================

I've tested BSVC under the following operating systems:

    Linux  2.x
    Solaris (SunOS 5.5.1)

The makefiles for these system should work.  I'm sure there are still 
bugs in BSVC so if you find any please let me know.

Installation
============

1) Edit the Makefile.common in the bsvc/src directory

     - Change PROJECT_BASE to where you have untarred the BSVC
       package

     - Change INSTALL_DIR to where you want the BSVC executables
       installed. (I usually install them in bsvc/bin)

     - Change WISH to the path/filename of the Tcl/Tk "wish"
       executable.  If you don't know where wish is then try
       'which wish' and see if it's in your path anywhere.

     - Change WWW_BROWSER to be your web browser of choice.  If
       your not on the net then just leave this blank.
       
2) Build the BSVC executables:

     - Choose the correct makefile for your system and do:

         make -f Makefile.your_os     (e.g for Linux use Makefile.linux)

     - If there is no makefile for your system then you'll have to make
       one yourself.  If you do then please send it to me so I can include
       it in the distribution.

3) Install the BSVC executable:

     - To install the BSVC executables do:

         make -f Makefile.your_os install


Testing the installation
========================

After you have built the programs there are some sample setups and programs
for the Motorola 68000 simulator in the bsvc/samples/m68000 directory.

Just cd to the bsvc/bin directory and type 'bsvc' to start the user interface.
Then choose "File / Open Setup..." and select the "serial.setup" in the 
bsvc/samples/m68000 directory.  After the system starts up choose 
"File / Load Program..." and load the "tutor.h68" program.  Press "Reset"
and then press "Run" in about 10 seconds you should see "TUTOR >" in the
xterm that appeared.

I would suggest adding the bsvc/bin directory to your PATH if you're going
to be using it very often.

There's a postscript version of the user manual in the bsvc/doc/manual
directory.
