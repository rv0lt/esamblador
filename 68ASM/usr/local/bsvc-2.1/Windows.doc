===============================================================================

This is the second release of the Windows version of BSVC.  If you find 
any problems please send mail to bwmott@acm.org.  You should probably
consider this BETA level software.  Tcl/Tk for Windows is still in its
early phases and a little slow.

Installation
============

After you've downloaded the Windows BSVC distribution and the Tcl/Tk
distribution for Windows you can install BSVC on your system by:

  1) Double-clicking on 'tcl803.exe' to install the Tcl/Tk distribution
     (Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the Tcl/Tk installation)

  2) Execute the self-extracting archive, bsvc-2.1-win32.exe, by 
     double-clicking on it (this creates the subdirectory BSVC-Setup)

  3) Open the BSVC-Setup directory and double-click on 'setup.exe'

  4) Follow the on-screen instructions to install BSVC

  5) You can delete the BSVC-Setup directory and all its contents


Testing the Installation
========================

After you've installed BSVC you can invoke the BSVC user interface by
selecting the BSVC entry that was added to the Start/Program menu.  

Once you've started the user interface choose "File / Open Setup..." and 
select the "simple.setup" in the "Samples/m68000" directory.  After the system
starts up choose "File / Load Program..." and load the "example.h68" program.
Open the program listing window by choosing "Window / Program Listing" and 
then press "Reset".  You should notice that the first line of the program
is highlighted.  Press "Run" and the simple program will be run to completion.

When you installed BSVC the 68000 assembler (68kasm) was also installed.  You
can execute it from an MS-DOS Prompt as follows:

C:\ 68kasm -l example.s

This assembles the program 'example.s' and produces a listing (.lis) file 
and an object file (.h68).
