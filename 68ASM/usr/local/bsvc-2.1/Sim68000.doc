Motorola 68000 Simulator (sim68000)
===================================

The Windows version of sim68000 does not support the M68681 DUART 
device.  Hopefully, in a future release M68681 support can be added.

The following instructions are not currently implemented.  I'll be 
adding support ASAP or if some kind soul sends me some diffs with
them added it'll probably happen even sooner.
